## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I work with CSS custom properties and intervals from JS.

```css
:root {
  --grayish-blue: hsl(237, 18%, 59%);
  --soft-red: hsl(345, 95%, 68%);
}
```
And intervals with JavaScript
```js
let myInterval = setInterval(()  => ...)
```

### Useful resources

- [DOM manipulation](https://platzi.com/clases/dom/) - A useful resource for making changes within the DOM with JS
